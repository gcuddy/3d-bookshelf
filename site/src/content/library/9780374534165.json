  "description": "<p><b>The third volume —the book that made Karl Ove Knausgaard a phenomenon in the United States—in the addictive <i>New York Times </i>bestselling series, </b><b><i>My Struggle.<br></i></b><br>A family of four—mother, father, and two boys—move to the south coast of Norway, to a new house on a newly developed site. It is the early 1970s and the family's trajectory is upwardly mobile: the future seems limitless. In painstaking, sometimes self-lacerating detail, Karl Ove Knausgaard paints a world familiar to anyone who can recall the intensity and novelty of childhood experience, one in which children and adults lead parallel lives that never meet. <br><br>Perhaps the most Proustian in the series, <i>My Struggle: Book 3</i> gives us Knausgaard's vivid, technicolor recollections of childhood, his emerging self-understanding, and the multilayered nature of time's passing, memory, and existence.</p>",
